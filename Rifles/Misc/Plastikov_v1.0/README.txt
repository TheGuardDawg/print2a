### 3D Printable AKM-Pattern Receiver

This project represents the first known printable AKM-pattern receiver.  Tested over 10 versions, 3000 rounds of ammo, over the course of four months.
The end result is method and process to build out pre-headspaced AKM parts kits (specically AMD65 parts kits, you'll need to modify the rear trunnion area to use different rear trunnions).
The Plastikov is known to be able to survive over 1000 round when printed in eSun PLA+.  However, you must follow the directions in this readme and in the out text document closely in order to make this build safe - AKs are a violent actions and could fail violently.

### What you'll need:

     - PLA (Optionally Nylon [645 is tested good], PETG).  Materials with better heat resistance than PLA will let you dump more mags before needing to let the gun cool.
     - A printer capable of printing PLA (or the plastic you choose to use).  The Creality Ender 3 is capable of printing these mags, and costs only 200 bucks.  
     - The parts listed at the top of the other document 
		
### Print Settings

     - Orientations
	     Note that the included STLs are scaled and oriented correctly!
	 
         - Print rear receiver with the angled face flat to the bed.
         - Print the front receiver with the angeld face flat to the bed.
	
	 - Print Settings
		 If you print in eSun PLA+, follow these settings.  Failure to print hot enough will end poorly.
		 
		 - Nozzle Temp             - 230C
		 - Bed Temp                - 60C
		 - Brim                    - ON
		 - Supports                - Full - 45-deg threshold
		 - Layer Height            - 0.15mm
		 - Shells (aka perimeters) - 4 inner/outer (this may not be necessary, but works well for me)
		 - Bed prep                - Gluestick, optionally on top of Kapton Tape.

	- No matter what material you print it, it is important that you set your SUPPORT THRESHOLD to 45deg.  The receiver doesn't need supports underath the entire thing, assuming you are using a 0.4mm nozzle and 0.15mm layer height.
